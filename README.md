# Akamai Identity Cloud RCS Connector

Akamai Identity Cloud RCS Connector for synchronization between Akamai Identity Cloud and PingIDM / PingOne AIC.

**Connector Features:**
- Bidirectional synchronization (Akamai Identity Cloud ↔ PingOne IDM)
- Password migration
- Full support for custom attributes

<br>

**Note:** Custom attributes must be defined in both Akamai Identity Cloud and the PingOne IDM Native Console to be mapped and synchronized successfully.


## Setup

Install and setup the Java RCS: https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openicf/latest/connector-reference/java-server.html

Once Java RCS openicf is downloaded, create a tools directory in the openicf directory. Place these groovy scripts in this tools directory.

There are also 3 libraries that need to be installed. These are called secrets-api, chf-http-core, and json-web-token. These can be installed in the /lib/framework directory of openicf. These jar files can be found by installing the latest of openidm, and finding those dependencies in the openidm/bundle folder. OpenIDM installation can be found here: https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/idm/featured

For on-premises installations, follow these steps here: https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingidm/7.2/connector-reference/configure-connector.html#connector-wiz-REST.

## Configurations

Using the Platform UI, go to applications and browse app catalog. Select the Scripted Rest Connector.  

After creating the connector, set these configurations:

<table>

    <td>Service Address</td>
    <td>${Akamai Tenant URL}</td>

    <td>CustomizerScript.groovy</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Basic Mappings

**Akamai Identity Cloud → PingIDM:**
- In the Native Console, go to **Identity Management > Configure > Mappings**.
- Create a new mapping.
- Set the **Akamai Scripted REST Connector** as the *source* and the desired **PingIDM managed object** as the *target*.

<br>

**PingIDM → Akamai Identity Cloud:**
- In the Native Console, go to **Identity Management > Configure > Mappings**.
- Create a new mapping.
- Set the desired **PingIDM managed object** as the *source* and the **Akamai Scripted REST Connector** as the *target*.

After creating the mapping in either direction, you can configure property mappings to define which attributes synchronize between Akamai and PingIDM.

Example property mapping configuration:

### Supported Attributes
The Akamai connector supports all standard Akamai Identity Cloud attributes as well as custom attributes defined in your Akamai schema.
- To synchronize custom attributes from Akamai Identity Cloud into PingIDM, you must first define the corresponding custom attributes in IDM.

**Note:** It is recommended that all schema attribute policies are turned off in order to avoid attribute mapping complications.
